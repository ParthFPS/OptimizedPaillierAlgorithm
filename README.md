Optimized Paillier Algorithm — Python Implementation
This project is a Python-based implementation of the Paillier Cryptosystem, enhanced with an optimized approach for secure and efficient homomorphic encryption operations. The system enables secure computation on encrypted data, allowing addition and multiplication of ciphertexts without needing to decrypt them first.

🔥 Features
✅ Key Generation — Secure prime number generation and public/private key pair creation.

🔒 Encryption & Decryption — Fully implemented Paillier algorithm for integer-based messages.

➕ Homomorphic Addition — Perform encrypted addition directly on ciphertexts.

✖️ Homomorphic Scalar Multiplication — Multiply ciphertexts with plaintext scalars without decryption.

⚡ Optimized Computation — Leverages gmpy2 for high-performance modular arithmetic.

💡 Use Cases
Secure Voting Systems

Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

Encrypted Database Queries

Secure Data Aggregation

Prerequisites:
sudo yum install python3
pip3 install gmpy2
